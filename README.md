# zMultilogue
zMultilogue is a Multi-NPC dialogue system for Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 NotR, based on the solution form [AFSP Trialogue package](https://github.com/Bad-Scientists/AF-Script-Packet/blob/main/Standalone-Packages/G12-Trialogue/trialogue.d).
Its goal is to replace Trialoue packages based on [Ikarus](https://github.com/Lehona/Ikarus) and [LeGo](https://github.com/Lehona/LeGo/tree/dev) with an union-based plugin.

## Features
- System for creating dialogues with multiple NPCs that doesn't fuck up AI queue
- Script interface based on the LeGo [Trialogue package](https://github.com/Lehona/LeGo/blob/dev/Trialoge.d) (easy to port dialogues)
- Automatic increasing of dialog-box display distance if NPC is too far

## ToDo

- [x] Implement the basic functionality of the multilogue system
- [x] Increase the default display dialogue distance if needed
- [ ] Custom camera system
- [x] Gothic 1 compatibility
